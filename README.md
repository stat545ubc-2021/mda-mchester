# Mini-Data Analysis

##### What is this project?

I made this repo to complete milestones for the mini-data analysis for STAT 545A. In Milestone 1, I selected one dataset (cancer_sample) from several available datasets within the ```datateachr``` library. Four research questions were proposed as a result of visualization and exploration of this data set. In Milestone 2, I explored each dataset and research question further.  

##### What files are here?

1. ```mda-mchester_m1_files``` contains files of outputted plots for visualization and exploration from Milestone 1.
2. ```mda-mchester_m2_files``` contains files of outputted plots for visualization and exploration from Milestone 2.
3. ```mda-mchester_m1.md``` knitted ```github document``` from Milestone 1. 
4. ```mda-mchester_m1.Rmd``` original R Markdown file from Milestone 1. 
5. ```mda-mchester_m2.md``` knitted ```github document``` from Milestone 2. 
6. ```mda-mchester_m2.Rmd``` original R Markdown file from Milestone 2.
7. ```README.md``` describes the project.
