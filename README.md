# Mini-Data Analysis

##### What is this project?

I made this repo to complete Milestone 1 of the mini-data analysis for STAT 545A. Ultimately, I selected one dataset (cancer_sample) from several available datasets within the datateachr library. Four research questions were proposed as a result of visualization and exploration of this data set. 

##### What files are here?

1. README.md
2. mda-mchester.Rmd
-This file contains explores several datasets from the datateachr library, selects one final dataset for visualization, and discusses four potential research questions.
