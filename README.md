# Mini-Data Analysis

##### What is this project?

I made this repo to complete milestones for the mini-data analysis for STAT 545A. In Milestone 1, I selected one dataset (cancer_sample) from several available datasets within the ```datateachr``` library. Four research questions were proposed as a result of visualization and exploration of this data set. In Milestone 2, I explored each dataset and research question further.  

##### What files are here?

1. ```mda_mchester_files/figure-gfm``` contains files of outputted plots for visualization and exploration.
2. ```README.md``` provides detail on what the project is about, which files are present, and how to run the code.
3. ```mda-mchester.Rmd``` contains explores several datasets from the datateachr library, selects one final dataset for visualization, and discusses four potential research questions.
4. ```mda_mchester.md``` is a knitted ```github_document``` for the purpose of review and evaluation.

##### How can you run code?

- Start new branch
- Pull the repo down to RStudio from GitHub
- Make changes, save, commit (and comment), and push the repo back to GitHub
- Make a pull request and suggest new changes to main
