# Mini-Data Analysis

##### What is this project?

I made this repo to complete milestones for the mini-data analysis for STAT 545A. In Milestone 1, I selected one dataset (cancer_sample) from several available datasets within the ```datateachr``` library. Four research questions were proposed as a result of visualization and exploration of this data set. In Milestone 2, I explored each dataset and research question further. In Milestone 3, I sharpened my skills and plot creation and model fitting.

##### What's in each folder?

1. ```milestone_1``` contains files, a README.md, as well as an .Rmd and .md file from Milestone 1.
2. ```milestone_2``` contains files, a README.md, as well as an .Rmd and .md file from Milestone 2.
3. ```milestone_3``` contains files, a README.md, as well as an .Rmd and .md file from Milestone 3.
4. ```output``` contains .csv and .rds files.
5. ```README.md``` quickly describes the project.
